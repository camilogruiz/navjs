# Huge Navigation Exercise

## Overview

This exercise will have the candidate build a responsive site navigation driven by an AJAX request.

Here are the guidelines for this exercise, please follow closely:

* No javascript frameworks or libraries (e.g. jQuery, Angular, React).
* CSS Pre-Compilers are fine (LESS, SASS), but no mixin libraries (Compass, Bourbon, Neat, Foundation, etc.)
* Chrome compliance is all that's required, all functions and features available in Chrome are in play.
* Nav must be responsive.
* Code must run after the following command, please ensure your code runs as you expect it to from a fresh checkout with these commands before submission.
* Page should look good across all viewport sizes.
* ZIP file and contained folder must be YourName_HugeNavExercise.zip.
* Please do not include node_modules folder in the ZIP.

```
$ npm i && npm start
```

Nice to haves (things that we look for):

* Adherence to accessibility standards
* Documentation
* Unit and/or E2E tests

At a high level the navigation will have two main states:

* <768px: Mobile. Hamburger icon will display in the top-left of the page. Clicking the hamburger will cause a card to slide in and overlay the content from the left. The card will contain nav and sub-nav items defined in the JSONP response
* \>= 768px: Desktop. The nav will display as a horizontal nav. Top level nav items will display sub-nav items when clicked. No hamburger will be shown.

## Version
0.1.0

## Files

* Mockup - PDF file describing how the nav should behave
* server.js - node.js server that will host the site and provie the api to construct the nav

## API

* GET /api/nav.json - returns a JSON response representing the items in the nav.

## Get Started
